<P>
	Team was up at 5:00 and preparing for the day. they decided not to leave at 8:00 but stay and fully charge the batteries. At 8:30 Shadow left with their observer still with the team.  With Tim at the wheel, Shadow was traveling at 32kph and charging the batteries, a new experience. The information on the Industrial Drive motor was by word of mouth, that it was a 5000 RPM motor.  It turned out to run at 2800 RPM.  At 9:07 Shadow was stopped to change to a larger motor gear, a 14 tooth gear. The change took only eight minutes. The speed was raised to 38 kph and the car was still charging.  The efficiency of the I.D. motor was vastly superior to the Solectria. By noon the power trackers had to be turned off because the batteries were fully charged. At 11:19 the chain seamed noisy so Shadow was stopped and the chain was inspected and lubricated. Down time 4 minutes.
<P>
	At the Dunmarra, 12:40, Joe changed the motor gear to a larger, 16 tooth gear, while Erika replaced Tim as the driver.  The gear change required a larger chain, Joe made the change within 8 minutes and we were on the road again.  At 40 kph the car was running great and still putting power into the batteries. Day three was turning out to be a great day. At Elliot fuel was needed for the motor homes.  Lead motor home was sent ahead to fuel first and Shapiro then acted as lead while chase fueled and Shadow kept moving. There was good sun all day and the car ran great.  The team camped along the road at Powell Creek Station. 306.5 kilometers for day 3, and still in the race.
<P>
	 The stars were spectacular that night.  Erika and Rosanne were told to sleep in the motorhome. Erika had been the target of most of the mosquito bites received by the team the past three evenings. She had at least 50 bites and needed a good nights sleep.
