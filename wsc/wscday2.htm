<P>
	Up at 5:15 everyone was up quickly and putting their sleeping gear into a pile to be loaded into the Scriven's trailer. The changing stand was moved into place and the car readied for charging.  At first light the charging begin.  The array performed well and the batteries were charged  to three quarters full. At 8:02 Shadow was on the road with Erika at the wheel.
<P> 
	 One problem we discovered was the ability to take down the charging stand quickly once the array was removed. The job had to be finished before Shadow could leave.  Though there where still some hills Shadow averaged 37 kph for the first half of the day.
<P> 
  At 9:25 we reached Katherine, taking our 30 minute press stop even though no race officials were there. Tim replaced Erika as the driver and Shadow was off at 9:55.  Clouds formed as noon approached, hindering charging. The batteries were used to make up for the lack of sun, they drained very fast and with them hope of reaching Dunmarra, the second days press stop. At12:30 with the batteries again dipping to final voltage, Shadow stopped to charge. We were at Mataranka, 420k south of Darwin.  After an hour the batteries were up enough to proceed. With a new driver, Kory Shadow left Mataranka at 1:29.
<P> 
	The observer, Rob was not very positive about our situation. As he rode in the chase motorhome he began to talk about calling in to the race officials and withdrawal from the race.  At 2:40, 463k south of Darwin, a flat on the right rear occurred.  The tire team jumped into action ready to make the repair. Joe jacked up the rear of the car and Joe started to remove the wheel nut.  The nut would not move, at first we thought that the nut had welded to the hub.  On closer inspection we noticed that one of the alignment pins had backed out of its threads and was blocking the nut from  turning.  A quick fix was to leave the nut and wheel in place, and  strip the tire and tube off the rim and replace them with the wheel on the car.
<P> 
	At 3:30 the convey was approaching the town of Larrimah.  Doc Shelton suggested Shadow stop early and charge.  The team's spirits were low and stopping at a campsite would be a good morale booster.  The scout vehicle was sent ahead to check out Larrimah.  Tina Shelton radioed back that she spotted the Larrimah Hotel and Caravan Park, our camp spot for the night.
<P> 
	Shadow was off the road at 3:55, one hour early.  Only 221 kilometers for day two, 137 kilometers short of Dunmarra.  Rob went to call the race officials as the team setup the charging stand.  Bob Franz was ask to come over to the hotel and talk on the phone with one of the race officials. It was explained to him that Shadow was not making the 300k per day minimum,  Franz was asked to signed some papers and LAVS was out of the race.  Rob said he was sorry about the situation and decided to stay at the hotel for dinner.
<P>  
	The team continued to work on Shadow and decided to change the motor from the Solectria to Cal State LA's Industrial Drive motor.  Tim inspected the brakes were also found to be dragging.
<P>  
	As Shapiro made dinner the team gathered to talk over the situation.  The team was heartbroken but decisions had to be made.  Each team member talked about how they felt. As they were speaking, Rob walked up to say good bye. He was on his way to catch a bus and head south.  Moved by the commitments of the team, Rob decided to recant the withdrawal and give the team one more day.  The team worked late into the night making changes. Tim and Mike swapped the motor.  Power consumption readings were taken from the Solectria motor.  Then Joe tested the Industrial Drive motor, what a difference, less than half the power at three different voltages. Tomorrow could be a very good day.
<P>
		The official observer's day report written by Rob Dietrich "Upon careful consideration the observer decided to stay with the Los Altos team to continue the race under official race rules. This was due to a total unanimous team commitment with determination to finish the race"
