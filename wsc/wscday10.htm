		Up early, the team could sense the possiblity of finishing. If only the winds would slow, Shadow could cross the finish line, 381k ahead. Everyone was moving, doing their jobs and getting the array ready to meet the sun's first light. This would have to be Shadow's best day.  In perfect conditions Shadow could do 381k, but with possible clouds and headwinds Adelaide might just be too far away. At 7:45 the team begin removing zone 3 from the charging stand. At 7:55 the main array was taken off the stand and shadow was readied.  Kory drove first, he had done a good job of conserving energy and that was the main goal of the day.
