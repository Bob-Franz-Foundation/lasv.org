	Left De Rose Hill Rail Station at 8:00 with Shadow running 40-42 kph. Erika drove first. Started seeing intermittent clouds at 10:00.  At 11:00 a driver change was made at Marla, a very small town north of Cobber Pedy. Tim took over for Erika and continued on.  Clouds got thicker and solar power dropped of significantly. Batteries were call on to make up the loss from the array.  At 2:00 another driver change was made, Kory replaced Tim and the 17 tooth gear was swapped with a 12 tooth. Kory crept along at 30 kph but we were moving and hopefully we would run out from under the clouds.  At 4:00 Shadow experienced a flat right front tire. Joe, Tim and Dave Sadamoto made the change in two minutes and fifteen seconds, a new record. When the car came off the jack and was ready to go there was no power, Doc, Franz, Sadamoto and Tim lifted the array while Joe adjusted the motor controller to lower voltage setting. Total time for the tire and controller four minutes.

	We pulled in at 5:00 and camped along the road at Pootnoura Rail Station, 90 kilometers north of Coober Pedy.  Well short of our goal, we had only come 251k. The parking area was very long and wide. When chase II, the motorhome with the trailer arrived Shapiro asked where to setup the charging stand. A spot was chosen and the Scriven's proceed to unload their trailer with the team gear and setup the Lou, the port-a-pottie. A few moments later it was decided to move the stand 40 yards feather down the parking lot.  This let Billo with a pottie and the teams gear far from the camp.  When Shadow and chase I arrived Billo was somewhat upset and using some interesting Australian language. The team carried their gear to the new camp spot and Billo decided to leave the pottie where it was. In good spirits he said that we could all jog to the Lou if we needed it. Franz was upset but he too cooled off.  Shapiro cooked Mexican and the team was in good spirits. About midnight it started to rain. the array had been tied down. And some of the team was sleeping under it.  Joe, Kory, Jerry and Tim were sleeping under the ROP easy-up.  The downpour overwhelmed the easy-up and it ripped, dumping large amounts of water the team members.  With soaked sleeping bags, the four took cover in the motor home.
