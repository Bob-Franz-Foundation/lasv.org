		The team was up by five o'clock and everyone was doing the daily routine.  The sun was great, but it was cool and windy. The battery charging went well, the team took down zone three early because battery voltages were coming up quickly.  We lined up on the road at the point marked by Paul the day before.  It was 8:12 and we were waiting to make our 8:16 start time when Hama Zero's lead vehicle passed us. Now on day 9, we were in a solar car race. Before Hama Zero's solar car could pass Paul waved Shadow off, at exactly 8:16. Hama Zero's solar car passed Tim as he was accelerating. Their convoy became mixed in with ours as the cars dueled. Shadow passed  Hama Zero moments latter, it was exciting.  Ten  kilometers later in some hills Hama Zero inched past Shadow and continued to move ahead slowly. Twenty minutes later they were about a kilometer ahead.  We did not have the ability to catch them or the desire.  A lesson learned in Dallas was that it is best to run at your own pace. Two hours later we passed them, pulled over on the side of the road charging.  We would not see them again.

		With head winds of  20kph,Shadow was traveling at 43 kph. This meant the aero term was 63 kph and energy would be used up quickly. Tim drove for 171 kilometers and there was a driver change at Glendambo. Erika drove to Pimba where she changed places with Stanley. Shadow encountered some very large downhills and achieved speeds of 60 kph plus. Stanley handled the car very well. He continued on to Narkanna H.S, 91 kilometers north of Port Augusta. We had traveled 351Kilometers even with the constant head winds.

		Leadership decided to have the team sleep in the motor homes and in the trailer. They needed a good nights sleep out of the elements.  The wind blew hard all night, but there was no rain.
