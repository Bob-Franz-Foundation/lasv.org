<P>
 	In the morning the camp looked bad. The red dust had turned to mud and team was wet and tired. During the night a truckee pulled in and Franz talked to him.  He said there was rain to Port Augusta and that there were several solar cars camped all the way down.  That morning the team attempted to charge but the array was dirty and there was little sun.  The solar group worked on the array washing it and cleaning it very carefully.  They did a great job as did the rest of the team. Roseanne made plugs to stop the air flow through the naca ducts.  Tim looked sick, the decision was made to use Stanley and let Tim have some time get well.

	Shadow left in a misty rain at 8:00 with Erika driving. The 12 tooth gear made Shadow creep along at 25 k. At that speed the power consumption was less than 400 watts. Ten kilometers north of Coober Pedy a driver change was made.  Stanley replaced Erika and she moved into chase II, trying to get warm.  How ironic, we had worried about keeping the drivers cool and now we had to try and keep them warm.  Stanley did a good job using the battery power sparingly in the dense cloud cover and sporadic rain. 25 kilometers south of Coober Pedy Shadow reached final voltage, the point at which the car must stop.  We pulled off the road to try and charge. Things look bleak, it was only 12:30 and Shadow batteries were drained. The team held a meeting to discuss the options.  Packup, pull out the generator and charge or continue to trickle charge from the solar array.  A couple of team members would have been happy to pack up and head south but the majority wanted to stay the course. At three o'clock the decision to try and move south and try and find better weather.

	Kory slowly pulled on the road and the convoy headed down the Stuart, very slowly. For 35 Kilometers we progressed under heavy clouds with no sun insight, then suddenly we saw sunlight. We had driven out of the clouds and the last 20k we were running on sunlight. We passed a lone bicyclist and Tina invited him to dinner. At 4:40  we planned our camp site at the emergency phone and rest stop and sent chase II ahead. Ten minutes before we stopped we passed Hama Zero stopped on the side of the road  their array off and charging.  To get to the rest stop we had continued  ten minutes past five.

	At the campsite the sun was shining and the batteries were getting good power, eight to nine amps. There were large puddles of water indicating the recent downpour.  It was cold but everyone was happy to be out of the clouds. North there was still dark, telling us we made the right decision to creep ahead. The rest area was on  the edge of a high plane and the view was spectacular.
<P>
	 The cyclist arrived, he was from Germany and was riding alone from Darwin to Adelaide. He spoke English well and said that he had passed Hama Zero just  seven kilometers back. Just before dark the Italian solar cycle team stopped by to wish us luck.  They were on their way to Adelaide. They had been the team that suffered the heart attack and death. In their limited English they encouraged us to finish not just for as but for all the teams that didn't make it.  
<P>
		Paul, our observer had been an inspiration that day, encouraging the kids and helping us keep the faith. Two days before he had been up most of the night helping the team members in the downpour. In these few days he had become one of us.
