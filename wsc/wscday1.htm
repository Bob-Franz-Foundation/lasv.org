<P>
At the Esplanade Solar Shadow was positioned number 33 on the starting grid, reflecting its qualifying ranking from the previous day. As the cars readied for the eight o'clock start time, Joe Muro was preforming a continuity check when he found a voltage in the cockpit. The problem prevented Shadow from starting on time. The problem was traced to a chafed battery pack cable which was grounding on the composite chassis.
<P>
By 8:55 Tim Hardley powered Shadow of the starting grid. The crowd which had gathered cheered as Shadow's convoy moved off the Espanade. One hour late, the clear sky had turned cloudy.  The eight stop lights which had been set green to allow the solar cars to pass without interruption had been returned to normal operation. Shadow hit all eight lights, having to stop and accelerate each time wasting precious energy.  The teams spirits rose as we passed our first competitor pulled off the side of the road making repairs.  The Stuart Highway soon changed from a four lane Highway to a two lane road. We passed five more cars, in the first 100 kilometers including our stable mates for NTU Team California.  The clouds persisted and we pressed on at speeds of 40 to 50 kph. We were starting to enter the hills and were still passing slower cars when we came upon an ambulance, later we found out that one of the Italian solar bike team members had died of a heart attack. Shadow continued to pass slower cars as long lines of trucks and cars waiting to get by the convoys.
<P>
At 12:10, 147k south of Darwin, Shadow had its first flat tire, as the Joe Muro and Jerry Heaps jacked up the car, it was decided to make a driver change as well as reconfigure the electrical system for the Solectria controller. This allowed Shadow to push 80 amps through the motor, power needed to climb the four kilometer  hill at Hays Creek. The solar array had to be removed in order to make the modification.  With the changes made, the array was fastened to the chassis and Kory Quon, the new driver, attempted to start moving, Shadow would not respond.  Off came the array again and the electrical team looked for the problem.  The culprit was finally found, a circuit breaker left in the off position. The total stop time 50 minutes.
<P>
With hills for the next 20k, the speeds were very slow.  Doc and Mike Merchant monitored Shadow's batteries, watching for low voltage, a signal to stop and charge the car. At 1:55, 187k south of Darwin, it was decided to change back to the AERL controller to conserve power.  Shadow stopped and was rolled off the highway for safety wedged carefully between the two motor homes.  A quick change was completed and the chase motor home moved onto the road to protect Shadow as it was pushed off the shoulder by Tim and Joe.  Time for this stop, another 14 minutes.
<P>
At 3:00, 221k south of Darwin, Shadow experienced a second flat.  This time the front right tire blew and the repair crew of Tim, Joe and Jerry did a fast of changing rims. Pushing the car back on the road Shadow's steering was pushed to the stops and the tie-rod bolt came loose.  Tim took several minutes to assess and repair the problem. When Kory tried to get Shadow rolling there was no power.  The array had to be removed and the voltage adjustment on the controller lowered. Total stop time 14 min., a good time for so much work.
<P>
The rest of the day was slow going  at 4:11 with one battery very low, we stopped on the side of the road between Ferguson Creek and Edith River. Shadow had only travelled 259 kilometers, well short of  Katherine.
<P>
We had lost just over 200 minutes of running time the first day including the first hour of the race. One battery was significantly lower than the others, one cell was dead.  The team decide to take a nine minute penalty and change the bad battery.  Rob Dietrich, was notified of the decision. Late that evening Hans Thultrope drove up, waking the observer, Rob Dietrich  and Bob Franz.  Hans talked about the fact that we had not made the press stop. Rob mentioned our delay at the starting line. Hans said that he was concerned about the cars that could not achieve 40 kph not the cars that had problems that could be worked out.  He left saying that he hoped we could catch up and make Dunmarra tomorrow.
