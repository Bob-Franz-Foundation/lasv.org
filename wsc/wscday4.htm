<P>
	Up at 4:30, before the flies. They were the worst encountered yet.  Breakfast was very interesting, the fly dance came into full swing.  The convoy was reorganized on day four to make setting up and tearing down the charging stand easier. Shapiro would now drive the motor home with the trailer, that way he could stay behind and break down the stand while Shadow left to race.  this meant that the Legend would act as lead.  While this made logistics easier it made some bored team members who were relegated to looking at the rear of  the motor home instead of seeing Solar Shadow.

 	Shadow left at 8:16  with Erika driving. Having stopped twelve minutes after 5 PM the day before we had to wait the penalty. With the 18 tooth motor gear speeds were 43-45 kph. Erika did a very good job except for her foot slipping off the pot on a hill. We saw the power drop on the telemetry and thought that there was a motor or controller problem.  The power required to get Shadow going up the hill again was 3000 watts plus.

	Rob wanted to leave us today, to move ahead and see the faster cars.  We had gotten permission to have Doc or Tina act as our observer until we got another one.  The Scriven's used there CB to contact a south bound 'Truckee', as truckers are called in Australia, and got Rob a ride.  Drivers were changed at 85k with Tim taking over. The car was running extremely well and we reached the press stop at Tennent Creek  at 1:30 (192 k).  We did our 30 minute press stop even through no race officials were there. Tim had been complaining about a noise. On inspection we found the make shift 18 tooth gear Billo Scriven had made had shifted and was rubbing on the motor housing. We decided to change back to the 16 tooth gear.  This brought the speed back down to 40 k but the car ran fine with Kory driving the remainder of the day.  He did a very good job of squeezing lots of kilometers out of little energy.  The campsite was along the road at Singleton Home Stead just south of Wauchape. Thinking that the motor gear problem was caused by misalignment Tim, Mike and Joe worked on modifing the motor mount. After charging and dinner that evening, everyone drove to the Wauchape Roadhouse for a shower.  The day was a success, 327 kilometers.
