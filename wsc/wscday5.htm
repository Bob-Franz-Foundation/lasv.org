<FONT SIZE=6>Thursday Oct. 31<BR>									Day 5</FONT>

<P>
	With 1107 Kilometers completed,  we were the last car still in the race.  The  Cal State's motor  had been a blessing it ran well and even pulled hills better than expected.  We had heard from the truckees that Annesley College was 50 k ahead.  Our goal for the day was Alice Springs, the mid point in the race.
<P>
	Up at 4:15  everyone else was moving by 5:00.  Tina, Dave Chen and Roseanne are leaving for Alice Springs to modify the Solectria motor gears for use on the ID motor and to wash clothes and by food. 6:00 and the legend leaves as Shadow is charging. At 8:00 Shadow left with Kory at the wheel. The car was running well for the first 100k.  Just past Barrow Creek the motor gear alignment key came out and the car came to a halt.  The array was lifted and a driver change, Erika for Kory was made while we looked for the problem.  At first it was thought that the charging rate was to high and the controller needed to be adjusted. When this did not cure the problem the drive system was looked at a second time and the missing key was identified. The problem was fixed and Shadow was on the road, down for only twelve minutes.  We were getting better at making repairs.  Erika drove for the next 120 kilometers, she averaged 40 kph.  Tim took over in the afternoon and we stopped at five o'clock, just 20 kilometers short of Alice Springs. The legend met us just before stopping time and found a truck parking area for us to camp. We had  our best day yet, 363 kilometers, but were not without problems. The telemetry went out in the afternoon, the second day that had happened around the same time.  A power tracker had blown because a loose mounting screw bounced up and shorted out a circuit. It was replaced with a spare.
<P>
	When we pulled in there were to many chief's giving orders and several things went wrong.  the charging stand was setup backwards and when the array was taken off the car and placed on the stand it didn't fit. Some yelling started and a couple of team members got hot.
<P>
	Even though we had our best day some of the students were frustrated and tired.  The team had worked very hard even before the race and now the adrenalin rash of the first few days was over and fatigue was setting in.   The team didn't sense the success we were having.  For the drivers and those in the chase vehicle things were sometimes exciting, but for those in chase II, the motorhome with trailer, the most exciting task of the day was setting up the charging stand. We needed to move some people around and let them take responsibility for different jobs. We decided to rotate people in the chase vehicles. The team held a meeting that afternoon to talk over the problems of the day. Camped across from a monument, 20 K north of Alice Springs, a363K day.
