<P>
	Sunrise at 6:00AM, good sun with no clouds.  The array was making good power.  About seven as the car was charging and the team eating breakfast, our new observer arrived.  Paul Abbot, a Telestra employee from Adelaide was our new observer and as we would find out latter, he would become a part of our team and good friend.  Tim installed the new 20 tooth gear that Dave Chen had machined in Alice Springs the day before. This gear would allow Shadow to achieve speeds of 45-47 kph.
<P>
	Shadow left the monument at 8:00  heading  down the hill into Alice Springs.  Tim reached speeds up to 65 kph running down the windy road.  Telemetry told the chase vehicle that zone one on the array was not functioning. It was decided that the array would be removed at the press stop and the power tracker inspected. There was some confusion entering the press stop.  Paul, riding in the chase motorhome wanted to follow the car into the hotel area.  Tina wanted chase to stay outside the hotel as per race instructions.  Paul said that this being the day after most of the cars came through already and there would be no problem pulling the motor home into the area.  After some quick changes of direction the motor home pulled off before the hotel area. Tina 1, Paul 0.
<P>
	With the array removed the problem with zone one was not the power tracker but a power diode used for telemetry. While zone one was being checked out an electrical team member shorted a screwdriver across the zone two tracker and it was smoked. It was decided to removed the blown tracker from zone two and move the zone three tracker into its position.  That lifted the team with only two trackers of the type needed to run the car.
<P>  
	Shadow was road worthy and left the 30minute press stop on time with Erika driving.  Rolling through the city, Erika had to go through a roundabout with traffic. The chase vehicle members were nervous but Erika did fine. There was also a left turn on the road, it was well marked but later we learned that Shapiro's motorhome made the wrong turn and headed to the airport.
<P> 
	The car ran well all day and Paul Abbott said he was impressed with our team's level of performance.  He explained that he had already observed for two different teams and that we looked good. At 2:30 Shadow reached Kulgera, with a driver change Shadow continued on.  That night we camped along the road just past De Rose Hill Rail Station. We had achieved 361 kilometers on day six. With only two trackers for three zones, it was time to adapt an older, larger power tracker for zone 3.  Zone 3  is stored in the rear section of Shadow while it was traveling.  The larger tracker need not be stored in a functional position while running so Erika and Dave Chen set out to connect the tracker into zone three.  Based on the weather reports, it was decided to run a 17 tooth gear.  Tim and Joe made the change to the gear and chain.
