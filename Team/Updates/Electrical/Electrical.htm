      We have successfully ordered and received our newest battery pack from Worley 
      Energy Cells in Singapore. The lightweight lithium polymer battery pack 
      is a 24V 13.2Ah pack that cost a total of $1750. We have begun drawing schematics 
      to integrate the pack into our fuel cell vehicle system. At the moment, 
      we are building a discharge/charge unit for the unique pack and also purchasing 
      a new 24V variable charger. We have also ordered all the components that 
      we will need to electrically complete Infusion. For rear-view vision, we 
      will use an LCD screen with a small video camera. For the motor/motor controller 
      setup, we have decided to use a system very similar to an electrathon vehicle. 
      We are still waiting on the order for our second fuel cell from Ballard 
      and contemplating the details of our system. Much more research, discussion, 
      and testing is to take place before any of the system is wired.<br />

      The solar arrays for both vehicles have been checked and LSIII's array is 
      still in good shape but LSII is in need of some minor repairs and new connectors 
      to the power tracker. We have checked to make sure that our two Newgen wheel 
      motors and two Newgen motor controllers are all interchangeable with each 
      other in LSIII and that all are in working order. We are awaiting the arrival 
      of several orders for meters, wire, wire shielding, connectors, etc. to 
      finish up the system in LSIII. Our latest problem with LSII is that the 
      frame was built incredibly small and many of the significant electrical 
      components, like batteries, motor controller, and power tracker, either 
      do not fit or fit in a very tight way. So a decision was made to cut off 
      the back end and re-size it so that the motor controller, power tracker, 
      shunts, and fuses will fit under the seat and under the swing arm. Also, 
      instead of using aluminum battery boxes (don't worry, we use insulation), 
      we are now planning on using custom fit composite boxes to create just a 
      little more room for the driver and the battery boxes to fit comfortably. 
      More adjustments are to be made to the frame and electrical system placement. 
      The new meters have been ordered and we are awaiting their arrival as well.<br />

      We will be recycling many, many old and dead batteries to get rid of more 
      junk and to make more room in our lab. We also took a trip to Southern California 
      Edison electric vehicle transportation division courtesy of Tom Knipe. We 
      got the chance to see the cutting edge technology of alternative energy 
      and battery cycling. Thanks to Tom Knipe and the staff for taking the time 
      to give us a tour. Kris Sorensen from WaveCrest Labs to visit our lab very 
      soon.</p>
