    <p>The construction of LS has started, &frac34; inch tubes have been pre cut 
      for chassis assembly. Life sized drawings from design are being used to 
      map out chassis. With the new computer specially order for Mechanical Team 
      has finally arrived and put together. Project Management soft-wear is being 
      used to plan out deadlines and Due dates for both LS II and Infusion. Rough 
      cutting for both LS II and Infusion hubs has been started and completed.</p>
    <p class="LargeBody">November 20, 2003</p>
    <p><br />
      This week the hangers for the fire-extinguishers have been fabricated and 
      installed in the welding area. Tacking of LS II chassis is in progress Jeff 
      A, Dan C, Przemek and Sam are in charge of putting together the car. The 
      first pocket has been machined out in the center section of the swing arm, 
      and the calculations for the side pockets of the swing arm has been done 
      and are ready for use. Also stock for front suspension for Infusion was 
      purchased from IPS. </p>
    <p class="LargeBody">November 22, 2003</p>
    <p><br />
      LS II and Infusion chassis have gained progress, LS II chassis is &frac14; 
      completed. Bulk heads on Infusion have been fitted, but minor changes are 
      needed in order for a firm fit.</p>
    <p class="LargeBody">November 24, 2003</p>
    <p><br />
      The bottom of LS II chassis was completed, a mock up of the top has been 
      stared.</p>
    <p class="LargeBody">November 25, 2003</p>
    <p><br />
      This week we have hit a big snag. The frame for LS II is designed wrong. 
      The top of the frame is too wide so it won&#8217;t fit inside its original 
      body; this means that we have to redesign it. The swing arm is almost done 
      There are just a few pockets left to do and the final adjustments.</p>
    <p class="LargeBody">December 20, 2003</p>
    <p><br />
      Today we have made great progress in the LS II frame. The top and bottom 
      are done and are linked together by each of the sides. The sides are coming 
      along nicely. We have a little more then half of all the side bars done 
      on LS II. The Fuel Cell car is being equipped with the suspension of the 
      Ballard Fuel Cell. The a-arms are being built and one is near completion.</p>

    <p class="LargeBody">LS II Chassis</p>
    <p><br />
      As you may already know, Los Altos Academy of Engineering is rebuilding 
      the LS II Chassis. The new model will consist of extra arm room, new suspension 
      for the front, and a smaller steering box. The frame is now in step two, 
      fabricating. The stock has been cut out, and all there is left to do is 
      assemble it. That is a mighty task, all parts of the frame need to be specially 
      fit in order to come together like a giant puzzle. Once the frame is complete 
      we could start on the suspension, this car is going to have trailing arm 
      suspension. This means that the a-arms would be on the side of the car, 
      going from the front of the car to the wheel location. Next the Mechanical 
      team will hand it over to the Electrical team which will mount all the electronics 
      and batteries to make this car go. Then it&#8217;s onto Composites which 
      would fit on the bottom pan, or the under body, to LS II. </p>

      Torsion Plates &#8211; To holding the torsion bars together and provide 
      pick up points for the front suspension.</p>
    <p>Bolt Inserts &#8211; Made from aluminum, allow the bolts on the bulkheads 
      to sit farther in.<br />
      <br />
      PROBLEM<br />
      - Cracks were found in the 4th and 5th bulkheads. Composites are not strong 
      enough to support the weight on the bulkhead.<br />
      - Positioning 2nd pick-up point on front suspension without hitting driver&#8217;s 
      box.<br />
      - Steering box position.<br />
      SOLUTION<br />
      - 1-inch steel rivets though the 4th and 5th bulkhead will give it the stability 
      it needs.<br />
      - Create a mockup of Torsion Plates to find the space limitation.<br />
      - Will attach a bar to steering box which will sit under the drivers box, 
      the bar will run and attach to the front bulkhead and connect to a series 
      of gears, this will allow for a second bar to connect to them and run back 
      towards the driver for proper steering capabilities.<br />
      <br />
      LSII<br />
      PROBLEMS<br />
      - Battery packs do not fit properly in the frame.<br />
      - Rear swing arm pick-up points are 2-inches too low<br />
      - Inefficient space for electrical components<br />
      <br />
      SOLUTIONS<br />
      - Placing an extension on the front of the frame to hold required batteries 
      / Creating composites battery boxes that fit closer to the batteries.<br />
      - Remove rear pick-up points and surrounding bars in order to move them 
      higher.<br />
      - When moving the rear pick-up point move drivers seat forward 3-inches 
      allowing more space for electrical components. <br />
