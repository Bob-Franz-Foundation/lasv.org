      Welcome to the Los Altos Human Powered Airplane page! LAHPA is a project 
      being worked on by a group of ambitious high school students. The idea for 
      it came about two years ago when several students found some information 
      on human powered airplanes and thought it would be a good challenge to attempt 
      one of their own.

      <IMG SRC="danart.jpg" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="201" ALIGN="RIGHT">After two years 
      of research, design, planning, and construction, the plane is very close 
      to completion. In fact, we came very close to flying the plane this past 
      summer. Unfortunately, we found several design flaws and ran into some unpredicted 
      problems that kept us from flying the plane on schedule. <BR>

      <P>According to our sources, no high school in the United States has ever 
        constructed a human powered airplane. This gives us an opportunity to 
        be the first high school to ever accomplish this. Up to this point, we 
        have rceived support from many companies and organizations, mostly in 
        the form of monetary and equipment donations. We are working extremely 
        hard to accomplish our goal. In order for our continued success, we need 
        support from everywhere possible. Thank you for your intrest in our project, 
        and any comments and questons regarding our project would be welcomed.</P>
