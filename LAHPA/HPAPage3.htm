        <TR><TD>Nelson is now helping with the LAHPA page. The intended goal this summer was to assemble the entire plane in our school gym, but due
to the lack of time we could only get the airframe up. This was still a major goal for us. We now have all our wires labeled and also gained a
great deal of experience. Problems were also brought to our attention. The pitch on the prop was incorrect and now we must do some more
research to solve that problem. The plan now is to get the plane ready to fly between the months November and December. Another happy
note is that Dr. Paul Illian, head of The Raven Project (<a href="http://www.ihpva.org/Raven">Raven HomePage</a>), is willing to help us in
the flight of the airplane. </TD>

          <TD>Keith is taking over the maintenance of the LAHPA page from Arthur. 
            This is the first update since last year. Over the summer, the members 
            of the LAHPA team went to the San Bernardino International Airport 
            to assemble and fly the plane. After nearly completing the assembly, 
            we attempted a pull-test of the plane when, unfortunately, one of 
            the wing sections broke, damaging an 18 ft. tube. After unsuccessfully 
            trying to fix the plane, we headed back for Los Altos disappointed 
            and very tired. Since the beginning of the school year, we have done 
            several things in a positive direction. First off, we recruited several 
            new team members since we lost the majority of the old team to college. 
            We have held several fund-raisers and have earned several hundred 
            dollars. We have also sent several thank you letters as well as a 
            request to March Airforce Base to use thier hangars to continue constructing 
            the plane as soon as possible. As far as actual construction goes, 
            we have nearly completed the drivetrain/prop assembly and hope to 
            have it spinning by next week. Last, we cleaned up our work room and 
            reorganized everything.</TD>

          <TD>Currently the HPA team is working on assembling the wing section 
            and the propeller. The team has postponed the flight date due to the 
            recent preparation for the S-Class race and some problems in the airport 
            arrangement. However, all members will work throughout summer to finish 
            the plane. The new flight date is now set to be August 1, 1998, and 
            it will be held at San Bernardino International Airport (Norton Airport). 
            Most of the materials have been purchased/donated.</TD>

          <TD>We had a meeting at lunch time and decided to order 28 pieces of 
            12 feet long, 2 inches wide aluminum tubing. The aluminum tubings 
            cost roughly $2,000! Several questions regarding the connections of 
            the spreaders also came up during the meeting. They are currently 
            being redesigned.</TD>

          <TD>We continued working on the rib templates. Arthur finally updated 
            the LASV.ORG webpage! The 1/16th scale model of Grasshopper is now 
            being worked on. Scaled drawings are also being made.</TD>

          <TD>The rib templates are getting near the final shape. We have decided 
            to purge the usage of balsa for the leading edge. We are now going 
            back to foam which is tougher and cheaper.</TD>

        <TR> 
          <TD>The rib templates are continued to be sanded for their original 
            rough cut outs are way larger than the proposed design. Balsa turned 
            out to work well for the leading edge. Balsa is light weight and yet 
            strong enough for our purposes. The price however is a drawback. </TD>

          <TD>Half-rib templates are being made with the full-size rib templates. 
            We have decided to use balsa wood for the leading edge. We tested 
            several pieces of thin balsa (1/8 inch) by soaking them wet with water 
            then bending them into the curved shape of the leading edge. We also 
            had a parent meeting at night. Lots of parents showed up and gave 
            their inputs. It was nice to know that our parents are willing to 
            give us support. </TD>

        <TR> 
          <TD>We have finished shaping the full-size rib templates. We came to 
            meet at CSF at night. The wing designs have gone under major redesigning. 
            We have decided to have eight twelve feet wing sections. There will 
            be 4 full size ribs on each wing section instead of 5. The location 
            of the spreaders will be on the third wing section on each side. Half-rib 
            full scale drawings will also be finished soon.</TD>
