<TR><TD>We continued gluing trailing edges side by side and edges to the rib support.
        The frame of the wing is formed.  We measured the weight of the wing section.
		The total weight of the frame is six pounds.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>The micro bubbles dried up.  We also sanded off the excess micro bubbles.  
        The wing is actually pretty stable.  Now we are starting to connect the 
		trailing edges to the ribs.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Today is a clean up day.  Everyone was assigned to clean a different 
        part of our workspace.</TD></TR>

<TABLE>
<TR><TD><B>OCT 31, 1997</B></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>The glue dried.  Since the support was not the exact size as the edge, 
        the sizes varied.  For the ones that are bigger, we decided to sand off 
		the support.  We made sure that we did not damage the original trailing 
		edges.  The support had the same even surface as trailing edge.  For the 
		supports that are smaller than the trailing edge, we decided to use 
		microbubbles to fill up the difference.</TD></TR>

<TABLE>
<TR><TD><B>OCT 30, 1997</B></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>We started hotwiring the supports for the trailing edges.  After making 
        the supports, we glued them on to the trailing edges.  Since we had to 
		wait for the glue to dry, this is all we did today.  The rest of the 
		period we cleaned up our workspace.</TD></TR>

<TABLE>
<TR><TD><B>OCT 29, 1997</B></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>We decided to make supports for the trailing edges.  We found the size 
        of each support needed.  We also assembled the wing.</TD></TR>

<TABLE>
<TR><TD><B>OCT 27, 1997</B></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>We hotwired the ribs to make them the exact same size as the new 
        templates that we made.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Today a new alarm system was installed.  We could not accomplish 
        what we intended to do because of this.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>We had a meeting this afternoon discussing new plans and goals.  
        We assigned each member  different task to accomplish.</TD></TR>

<TABLE>
<TR><TD><B>OCT 22, 1997</B></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>We could not get the table saw to flatten the surface of the trailing 
        edges.  We have decided to make new templates.  The old trailing edges 
		did not have ending edges as high as the ending edges of the ribs.  
		Thus, we decided to use the new templates to make additional parts for 
		the ending edges of the ribs in order for the old trailing edges to fit.

<TR><TD><B>OCT 21, 1997</B></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>We finally decided to use table saw to flatten out the curved surface.  
        If this does not work, we will probably need to make new templates and 
		fix the hotwire in order to make the surface as flat as possible.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><B>OCT 20, 1997</B></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Today is a student release day, but we managed to come in during the 
        morning to work on the wing section.  We replaced the wire and made it 
		tighter, hoping that we can make flat surfaced trailing edges.  We are 
		still deciding whether to make new trailing edges or to fix the old ones.

<TR><TD><B>OCT 17, 1997</B></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Due to equipment failure and lack of materials, we postponed the deadline 
        for finishing the wing.  The hotwire had a defect in which the wire bends.  
		All of the trailing edges did not have a flat surface.  We are probably 
		going to replace the wire on the hotwire and start over on the trailing 
		edges.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>We purchased the book Gossamer Odyssey from Barnes & Nobles for each team 
        member in order for each one of us to understand more about human powered 
		airplanes.  We also continued working on the trailing edges.</TD></TR>

<TABLE>
<TR><TD><B>OCT 15, 1997</B></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>We continued hotwiring both the trailing and leading edges.  We had a 
        meeting this afternoon discussing our accomplishments and our next task.  
		We also discussed about how to get financial support from schools such as 
		CalPoly Pomona and corporations such as Aerovironments.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><B>OCT 14, 1997</B></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>We continued hotwiring the trailing edges.  The support for the leading 
        edge was also glued on to the front of the ribs using micro bubbles.

<TR><TD><B>OCT 13, 1997</B></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>We hotwired the trailing edges for the wing section.  We had also started

<TR><TD>We used hole saws to cut four 3-inch and four 4-inch holes on the ribs to 
        reduce weight.  Every gram reduced means higher efficiency.  The weight of 
		each rib before cutting was 130.89 g.  After the cutting, each rib weighs 
		about 108 g.  Since we had a total of 12 ribs, the total weight saved 
		was 274.68 g.</TD></TR>
