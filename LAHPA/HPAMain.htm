    <FONT SIZE=3>Welcome to the LAHPA page.  We are a group of enthusiastic high 
    school students who are interesting on doing hands-on projects. This is when 
    the idea of constructing an HPA (human powered airplane) came into our minds.

     <TD>Originally we were considering to either build a solar powered bicycle or an 
     HPA. The decision was tough, for that we have put many things into consideration.
     If we went for the solar powered bicycle, we would have been less challenging
     since we already have experiences around solar powered energy.  Thus, HPA 
	 survived the rigorous debate.</TD>

     According to our sources, there was never any high school in the United States that had successfully built an
     human powered airplane.  This creates an opportunity for us to be the first high school to accomplish this task.
     Currently we have been getting support from AeroVironments, The Raven Project, and several Japanese Universities.
     We are working extremely hard to accomplish our goal.  The following are our prospectus and our weekly journal.</FONT>
