Students have been working on modifications all year. In April, the team attempted to assemble and fly the Grasshopper on campus. Paul Illian, an aerospace engineering from Boeing, flew to Los Altos to help. The team took apart the plane in the gym and at 3:00 they started reassembling it outside. Illian found two possible problems, but the biggest problem was the weather. A light mist started and the wind was above the flight parameters. At 6:00 the team leader, Tony Chang, called it quits and Illian flew back to Washington. The team felt really bad. To graduate and not fly the plane would be a three year failure. <BR><BR>On Friday, June 16, ten students once again moved the plane to the gym. At 3:00 the team started assembling the plane outside. The wind was above flight parameters, but the team was going for broke. Tony Chang, Keith Miyake, and Frank Kuo were three students who had been working on the Grasshopper since the flight attempt at San Bernardino in 1998. Time was running out. At 9:00 the wind was getting bad and at 10:30 it was decided to leave the center section of the wing unskinned and attempt flight anyway. <BR><BR>With only five sheets of plywood for a runway, the Grasshopper was moved to the lower field and the pilot attempted a flight. The drive chain came loose on the first attempt. The worried team decided to do a pull test. By 11:30, there were three attempts which failed because of poor communications. The team decided to fix the chain and try again with the pilotAgain no luck. It was decided that the pitch on the prop was not correct and another pull test was attempted. This time it was successful. Several more pull tests succeeded. <BR><BR>The winds were now way above the limit. It was 12:45, and one of the gravity wires that held the wing snapped. The team was holding the wing up and decided if they should fix it or just go for broke when the second of the three wires snapped. With the wing sagging to the point of breaking the team went for it. <BR><BR>Knowing that the wing would still lift and fly but would break on landing and that the wheels, designed to roll on concrete, would not work on the grass, Charles Kim started spinning the crank. The Grasshopper lived up to its name and hopped off the ground in its first true flight 3 feet high and flew at 8 m.p.h.. <BR><BR>A prop blade failed and broke off sending the plane to an abrupt crash. Only 56 feet, a short but magnificent conclusion to three years of hard work by a dedicated group of high school students. Tony Chang, project leader, was both happy and hurt. With the Grasshopper wrecked; it had still accomplished it's goal of human powered flight. <BR>&nbsp;</FONT></P>

Competing with other high schools from all over the United States, this was a chance for Los Altos to shine. The team, with the help of their advisor, Bob Franz, had been working every day to put on the finishing touches. The team consisted of team leader, Keith Miyake, and team members, Matt Casalicchilo, Danny Frederickson, Charlie Frederickson, James Lu, Will Zheng, Marv Yuen, Timothy Chan, Joyce Chen Jason Zheng, and driver, Jenny Liu. <BR><BR>On May 21, 2000, Lightspeed II got in the starting line along with the other s-class cars to begin the 2 1/2 hour or 100 kilometer race. Having set the national record back in 1998, Los Altos hoped to make even better time this year. From the beginning, the vehicle ran into some problems. One of the connections was loose, forcing the car to restart before it could run. At the end of the first lap, the hatch came off the car causing the driver to pull into the pit while holding the hatch with one hand. Once the car was in the pit, the connection problem still wasn't noticed and it took a while before the car started off again. <BR><BR>The car ran well for half of the second lap before the driver noticed a funny smell coming from underneath her. She stopped the car and the crew came out to inspect. There were problems with the fuse, and it took the team about 40 minutes to fix the car. <BR><BR>After that, the car ran smoothly for 32 laps, finishing fifth. Although Los Altos didn't achieve their goal, it was still a great experience for all of the members. &quot;It was an enriching experience that allowed me to learn many new things,&quot; said team member Marv Yuen. &quot;We did pretty well but next year, we're going to win.&quot;</FONT></P>

The fund-raiser they chose to use this year was the Adopt-A-Kilometer. Friends, family, and especially companies were asked to support the team by adopting a kilometer of the biggest race of the year, the 2000 Solar BikeRayce USA. In return, the team offered their small tokens of appreciation through T-shirts and plaques. In honor of the corporate sponsors, the team had their names put on the T-shirts. <BR><BR>In total, LASV was able to raise over $3,000. Over $2,000 came from companies such as: Modem Graphics, Forest Design Group, the McIntosh family, and Puente Ready Mix, Inc. Other companies also made generous donations in much needed materials including the solar cells on Lightspeed II. Without companies like Siemens, TECSTAR, California Steel &amp; Tube, Haddick's, and many others, this group of students would never be able to accomplish all that they have in the past year. </FONT></P>

The team started testing ideas in the field, and what didn't work was scrapped. The team had a solar bike that they felt couldn't compete with the other solar bike teams but that attitude always worked for them. The Solar Bike Team constantly looked for improvements they could make on the bike. They tried to build a perfect bike. From the finest machined parts to the fairing, they slaved to achieve perfection for three months. When all the improvements were finished, they were ready to race. They had a machine that they believed in. As they packed the bike into the van for the trip to Kansas, you could see the hope in their eyes and the relief that the bike was finally done. When they got on the plane, you can see the nervousness was beginning to set in. <BR><BR>May 21, 2000, race day. Tension was high. The others teams were from high schools around the nation. The Los Altos Solar Bike got 2nd and 4th place in the 400 meter sprint that determined the racing order. The team felt that they could take this race and improve on last years' race results. <BR><BR>As the race began, some teams started to sprint to the head of the pack. These teams were the ones that had to drop out of the race first, but Los Altos had a plan. The plan worked well and, when it was time to charge midway through the race, the team was already in first and fourth place. <BR><BR>Although the team had a hard time charging they felt that they had enough electricity to finish the race. The end came quick, the final results were first and seventh place. That made the team extremely happy, and also made them national champions in the A class. </FONT></P>

Students in the ROP Manufacturing Technology program at Los Altos were able to design and build their own dream car through the Daimler-Chrysler Build Your Own Dream Vehicle Competition. <BR><BR>Eight teams were formed to design and build their own car. Each team had to create a team name and the type of car that the general public would desire. In the limited amount of time, each team researched safety features, ergonomics, power systems, and many other factors that are included in building a real car. Also, each team figured out what were the best marketing methods and the financial factors in producing and selling a car. <BR><BR>Four out of the eight teams made it to the finals. They were Gemini Automotive, Environmental Concepts, Dynamic Innovations, and Horizons. The competition was tough since all eight teams were excellent. The results of the regional competition placed Alhambra High in third, Environmental Concepts in second (Los Altos) , and Horizon (Los Altos) first. <BR><BR>The Horizon team was given the opportunity to travel to Detroit to compete nationally. They placed second out of nine regions attending the national competition. <BR><BR>Even though not all the teams from Los Altos placed first in the Chrysler-Daimler Build Your Own Dream Vehicle Competition, they all had fun preparing for the semifinals and finals. Teammates bonded as they pulled all-nighters, trying to finish everything before the deadline. BYDV is a fun learning experience and, even if you don't win, the competition is a reward in itself. </FONT></P>

The ZEV 2000 race focused on the advancement of the current engineering programs of the region's high schools. The event was sponsored by the South Coast Air Quality Management District. The AQMD funded ten local high schools through a grant process, providing seed money for either an electrathon vehicle or a solar powered bicycle. <BR><BR>Students from nine high schools raced battery-powered and solar-powered cars and bikes. Race teams from Centennial High School, Canyon High School, South El Monte High School, Bell Gardens High School, Diamond Bar High School, Lakewood High School, Los Altos High School, Redondo Shores High School, and Schurr High School attended the race. <BR><BR>The race was divided primarily in to two classes, cars and bikes. Los Altos won the experimental car class with a modified version of Lightspeed II. This modification was sans solar array. Los Altos also won the men's division of the A class solar bikes. South El Monte's female A class team did even better, taking first place and setting a new national high school record for B class bikes. Every team had the experience of watching months and months of work come to fruition. <BR><BR>Bob Franz, instructor at Los Altos, worked with Ron Ketchem of the South Coast Air Quality Management District to develop a grant process which provided $15,000 for the ten schools. Irwindale Speedway also donated their new half mile Super Speedway for the two day event, allowing for qualifying and the actual race. Over 100 students competed in the ZEV Challenge.</FONT></P>
