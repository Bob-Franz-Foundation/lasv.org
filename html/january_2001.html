Everything that is being done to Solar Shadow II is accomplished by the students. Currently, the electrical team is in the design phase of the layout for various components to be put into the solar vehicle. The mechanical team is in the process of building a steel chassis. They are also in the last stages of building the rear suspension along with the dual rear swing arm. Soon mechanical will begin to build the front suspension of the car. Our design team has finished (CAD) computer aided drafting drawings for the swing arm, frame, suspension, and ribs for the solar array. The composite team is in the process of making battery boxes. Public relations has completed the Mervyn's and Federal Grant, and are currently work towards raising money to complete and race the solar car. </FONT></P>

ISAAQ members are concerned if other schools will meet the requirements. Members favored the idea, but wanted to move slowly. The ZEV 2001 will be held at Irwindale Speedway on April 29. The ZEV Challenge give students a unique experience that wouldn't be possible in a regular school. <BR><BR>A one hour electrathon and a 2.5-hour solar/electric bike race will be held by ISAAQ on Sunday, June 4 at Irwindale Speedway for students. Educational institutions are only allowed to participate in this event. This event will not only be a race but an evaluation of each team's knowledge of the construction and electric drive system of their vehicle. <BR><BR>On Saturday, January 13, we went to Irwindale Speedway to test our vehicles and to watch a Guinness World's electric RC car record. We tested High Voltage and LightSpeed II in preparation for the American Solar Challenge, where we will run Solar Shadow II. Testing our vehicles gave us a better understanding of how we will do in the ASC. Many students participated in this event in order to become aware of the responsibilities and actions that must be taken at ASC. Participating in this event allowed students to become familiar with the responsibilities that must be taken during the real race at the ASC. <BR>&nbsp;</FONT></P>

This year, six teams entered the competition including last year's second place team, Environmental Concepts. For the last four months the teams have been putting together a report on the marketing, finance, environmental, safety, and ergonomic aspects of their vehicle. The second part of the package is a foam model made and designed by the students. Haddick's Autobody &amp; Towing was very generous and painted the models for the teams. <BR><BR>Besides Environmental Concepts with the Ascent, the returning teams are Dynamic Innovations with the Serenity, New Quest with the Celera, and Gemini Automotives with Ambrosia. The two new teams this year are Harmonic Vibes with the Savant and Ergo with Evergreen. <BR><BR>The finalist teams, including Environmental Concepts, Gemini Automotives, Dynamic Innovations, Ergo, and Harmonic Vibes, have started to prepare for the second part of the competition. The finals this year will take place at the Loyola Marymount on March 15. Each finalist team will give a half-hour presentation explaining the different sections required for the competition. The winning team will then head to Detroit for the national competition. </FONT></P>

After much discussion and planning, the students and advisors have decided to compete in this prestigious event. The Formula Sun American Solar Challenge is the first transamerica solar car race starting in Chicago and ending in Los Angeles. As of now, Los Altos is the only high school racing down this 2,200 mile route along with university and international teams. <BR><BR>Before Los Altos can attend the race, the team plans to completely redesign and rebuild the chassis and frame of their former solar car, Solar Shadow. The same solar cells will be used because there is not enough time or money to make a new array. Nevertheless, the modified version, Solar Shadow II, should finish the race amongst the top competitors. <BR><BR>Besides rebuilding the solar car, the academy must also raise $35,000 to pay for all the materials and travel expenses for the race. Fifteen students and four adults plan to drive the course backwards to Chicago a week before the American Solar Challenge. The race itself will be from July 15-26. <BR><BR>The students, as well as the advisors, are all very excited about this new challenge. Although there is still a lot to do before the race, the team is very enthusiastic. Students are working on the car three days a week and a continuous effort is made to raise money for the race. By March we plan to hold some test runs so that we will be ready for the qualifier and the race. <BR>&nbsp;</FONT></P>

This year, the Los Altos Academy of Engineering has two new advisors to supervise and help the team for the American Solar Challenge. <BR><BR>One of the new advisors, Mr. Michael Scott, is aiding the electrical team by teaching them the techniques needed to accomplish the tasks at hand. Mr. Scott is a former Los Altos High School student who graduated in 1965 and later went from Mount San Antonio College to California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, majoring in manufacturing engineering. Mr. Scott got started in the electrical field by following his father's footsteps. <BR><BR>Mr. Scott met Mr. Robert Franz at the Arizona Public Services (APS) Solar Race held in Phoenix, Arizona. Since 1992, Mr. Scott has been working with our Engineering Academy. He retired a year ago from Scott Engineering and is currently working as a Regional Occupational Program (ROP) instructor. <BR><BR>Mr. Scott said, &quot;Going from an owner of an engineering company to being an ROP instructor is a different set of challenges.&quot; He teaches retail sales and machining. <BR><BR>Mr. Scott said, &quot;What I really admire is the students' desire and dedication to compete in these solar car races.&quot; <BR><BR>The students owe Mr. Michael Scott much gratitude for his contribution to the engineering program.  </FONT></P>

Mr. Keirns was born and raised in Ohio. Like Mr. Michael Scott, Mr. Keirns got in the business by following in the footsteps of his father, and started working for his father in a design prototype shop when he was 6 and he has been in the same business ever since. Currently this is Mr. Keirns 22nd year as the owner of KBS Engineering. In the past few years he has been designing and developing race car parts. He met Mr. Robert Franz in 1992, when Mr. Franz was looking for a past contact. A few years later, Mr. Keirns was planning to attend the World Solar Challenge in Australia with the Los Altos Academy of Engineering in 1996, however he couldn't attend. This year he is planning to attend the American Solar Challenge with the Los Altos Academy of Engineering. Since 1992, Mr. Keirns has helped the students in many ways. <BR><BR>Working with the Los Altos Academy of Engineering Mr. Keirns says, &quot;Its been fun.
