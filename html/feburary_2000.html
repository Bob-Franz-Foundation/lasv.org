This proposal would include joint work between the Academy and Tecstar for the next three years. During these three years, Tecstar would be helping the Academy with knowledge on the latest solar technology as well as material donations. The Academy would be able to help Tecstar secure a grant from NASA by working with their company. <BR><BR>For now, the Academy is getting assistance from Tecstar on a website project headed by member Keith Miyake. This website would include information on the latest solar technological achievements. Also, the Academy hopes for a solar cell donation which would be used toward the construction of their next solar vehicle, a similar version of Light Speed. As the joint efforts between the two parties progress, more information will be given about the new projects of the Academy. <BR><BR>On February 9, students fron the Engineering class went and visited TECSTAR. The students got a chance to see Solarmotion, the solar vehicle sponsored by TECSTAR which raced in the World Solar Challenge. <BR>&nbsp;</FONT></P>

It's not one of the Pokemon, it's tZero, the pure electric vehicle that's turning heads in the automotive industry. On January 8, 2000, Norman Smith, the project manager for tZero, and two former Los Altos students, David Sadamoto and Oscar Juarez, all from San Dimas based AC Propulsion, brought this amazing electric sports car to show off at our facilities. <BR><BR>When Mr. Smith drove up in tZero, the entire engineering building emptied, as everyone rushed to get a glimpse of this exotic beauty. After all, it's not every day you get the opportunity to see an $80,000 electric vehicle that does 0-60 in 4.08 seconds. And this is at a modest 200 horsepower, governed 90 m.p.h., and a curb weight of approximately 2400 lbs., half of which is in its 28 Optima batteries. After getting the opportunity to ride in tZero, Mr. Franz said, &quot;The accelerations phenomenal. It's like riding in a dragster!&quot; <BR><BR>While tZero's performance was amazing, even more amazing was all the engineering and technology that went into making it. It is made of a stainless space frame chassis and a composite body. Among its features are an integrated charging system that can plug into just about anything, and can recharge the car’s batteries in less than 15 minutes, a computer controlled system to monitor and regulate each battery individually, full traction control, and an add-on trailer that extends the range of the vehicle from 90 miles to approximately 400 miles. The trailer is an engineering marvel in itself. The patented BackTracker trailer is self steered to prevent jack-knifing and to track better at high speeds. In case you are interested, AC Propulsion is planning to sell tZero at an estimated $80,000, and is currently taking $2000 down payments to get a spot on the waiting list. </FONT></P>

The yearly advisory meeting is a requirement of the ROP. The Advisory Committee is comprised of Engineers and Manufacturers in the local area. The students take the advisory meeting concept one step further by meeting each member and taking them on a tour of the facilities. Each member gets a presentation of the projects and processes in which the teams of students are involved. The committee made many useful recommendations that will be utilized by the class. Members of the Committee include Dr. Michael T. Shelton from Cal Poly Pomona, Dave Tanner from TECSTAR, Mike Merchant from Southern California Edison, and Tom Frederickson from D.C. Engineering. From AC Propulsion: Ketan Ranade, Neil Baker, Christopher Alvarez, Norm Smith, Oscar Juarez, and Kent West. </FONT></P>

New modifications have been added this year since the last attempt at the San Bernardino Airport. The plane was fully constructed during the Summer of 1998, where a right wing section was broken during a push test. Furthermore, hard winds came into the doorless hanger and destroyed whatever was left of the fragile airplane. <BR><BR>The plane went through full reconstruction during the past 2 years and now has many new modifications. The previous cardboard leading edge, which was heavy and hard to work with, is now replaced with a lighter fiberglass leading edge which will take off 15 pounds to the light weight craft. Also the tail section went through major redesign and now weighs 10 pounds less, through the replacement of aluminum tubes with a stronger and lighter fiberglass/carbon fiber tubes. Drive controls, which were missing during the first flight attempt, are also being added in order to steer the plane for our next try at flight. <BR><BR>Currently, the plane is near completion. The final twelve foot wing sections are underway and the remaining sections only need the Mylar skin to be ready. In order to get permission to fly the airplane this Spring Break at the March Air Force Base, LAHPA is in need of insurance for the plane. The team will assemble the Grasshopper in the Los Altos gym from February 11th-13th for the media, in hopes of finding a sponsor who will help get the insurance we need. <BR><BR>This project has motivated us a lot and the excitement of watching this project succeed is constantly pushing us to keep working hard. The Los Altos Human Powered Airplane project has been going for the last 3 years and our team hopes to see flight sometime this year. </FONT></P>

Among the eight teams from Los Altos are the first, second, and third place teams from last year. Dynamic Innovations, last year's first place team, consists of returning members Tony Chang, David Tsai, Michelle Liu, Nelson Lee, Jenny Liu, Theresa Chen, Jesse Lee, and new member Jonathan Hsiung. The second place team, Alternative Energies, has returning members Cathay Liu, Natalia Huang, along with new members Karen Chang, Sun Tang, Stephanie Wei, James Chen, Todd Sadamoto, and Joseph Xu. New Quest, the third place team, came back with Geoffrey Cook, new members Sandeep Lad, Charles Kim, Katy Hung, Rolland Coburn, Rene Varela, Lisa Aiu, and Joseph Franchino. Another notable team, Environmental Concepts, winners in both 1997 and 1998, have returned with Timothy Chan and new members Brian Tagiku, Daniel Mai, Edith Tchon, Philip Song, Jessica Lu, Bobby Lee, and James Lee. <BR><BR>Most of the teams were able to have their models professionally painted with the help of Laurie Marshall from Haddick's, a local auto body shop. This, along with a comprehensive report on the Marketing, Finance, Environmental, Ergonomics, and Safety aspects of the vehicle was mailed out on the twenty-first of January. Regional finals will be held at Cal Poly Pomona on March 30th in which four of the eight teams from Los Altos High School: Dynamic Innovations, Environmental Concepts, Horizon, and Gemini Automotives will give a thirty minute presentation on their concept vehicle. Anyone interested in viewing the presentations are invited to come. Also, the winner from each region will go on to compete in nationals held at the Detroit World Headquarters some time in May. The teams are working hard to finish before deadline, each with the hope of making it to nationals.</FONT></P>

In order to supply their organization with much needed materials, the SBT members started candy sales. Not only do they need to maintain their lead bike, they also have extra bikes in case of any emergencies. Members of the Solar Bike Team have learned how to build and machine many of the mechanical and electrical parts of their bikes. They are currently building a remarkable windshield fairing that will not only make the bike look great but also create a more aerodynamic form. On the weekends, riders train hard to be in shape for the competitions. <BR><BR>Besides the Kansas Solar Bike Rayce, the Bike Team will also be competing in a series of races including the L. A. Marathon’s solar bike division. They will also be competing in the California Solar Bike Rayce with a very good chance at first place.

KBS has been one of the longest ongoing sponsors of the Los Altos Academy of Engineering with such people involved as Mike and Brian Keirns. Keirns has helped the Academy from the time of their first electric car, Speed Racer, up until their latest electric car, High Voltage. Students from the Academy went to Keirns recently for some technical advice for High Voltage. They scrutinized High Voltage and helped them see all of the pros and cons of their car. Mostly, the Academy wanted to concentrate on the bad points so that they could improve their current car and also make design revisions for future cars. Besides the bad points, Keirns was very at ease in talking about the quality of the Academy's car. Keirns was very surprised at the improvement over the Academy's previous projects but, mostly since their first car. After talking with them about improving their car, Keirns agreed to help the Academy with building new hubs for their car. These hubs could be built with the resources in the schools current lab, but with their machinery they cannot achieve the precise measurements they need. Keirns also modified a pulley for the Academy that they currently use on their Formula race cars. The Academy will now have to change this pulley to make it lighter and correct the width. KBS gave this pulley to the Academy at a very discounted price. While there, they talked about ideas for suspension, both theories of suspension setup and how it can be utilized on their car. With time and testing they can determine the best handling suspension for their car while still retaining a very efficient setup. While there, students had a chance to look at the current project KBS is working on. They were in the final stages of constructing a Formula race car. This was very important for the students to see in that they got a look at a professional car in both quality and safety. It also helped them understand more about suspension setups and frame structure. Overall this trip to KBS was very valuable to the furthering of the students knowledge in the field of Engineering. </FONT></P>
