      <p align="center"><span class="LargeBody">1. Q: What is a human powered 
        airplane?</span><br />
        A: A human powered airplane is just as the name implies. It is an ultra-lightweight 
        aircraft powered solely by a person onboard. In our case, the pilot pedals 
        a bicycle-like crank, which pulls a chain that in turn, spins a propeller, 
        pushing air, causing the plane to move forward, forcing air to pass over 
        the wings, causing the wings to get lift, and ultimately, lifting the 
        plane into the air (we hope). There are numerous other designs out there, 
        but ours is one of the simplest. To see some other human powered airplanes, 
        go to the Raven website or Birdman Rally Competition page, listed in the 
        links.</p>
      <p align="center"><span class="LargeBody">2. Q: So what's so great about 
        human powered airplanes?</span><br />
        <br />
        A: First off, there are only a few successful human powered airplanes 
        in the world, so making one of our own is a pretty cool thing. Second, 
        human powered airplanes are an incredibly difficult to engineer (from 
        experience, solar cars are much easier). Finally, they introduce a lot 
        of ideas about lightweight aircraft and require new paradigm, which has 
        far reaching benefits in all sorts of aviation applications, and beyond.</p>
      <p align="center"><span class="LargeBody">3. Q: Why are you trying to build 
        a human powered airplane?</span><br />
        <br />
        A: Good question. We are still trying to figure that one out ourselves. 
        Just kidding :-) First off, we are crazy to try and build a human powered 
        airplane because of all the time and work needed to complete it. So why 
        are we doing this? Mainly for the self-satisfaction of building something 
        that no other high school in the nation has built. And we get to meet 
        some really cool people too!</p>
      <p align="center"><span class="LargeBody">4. Q: This project is great and 
        all but who works with human powered airplanes?</span> <br />
        <br />
        A: You mean other than a bunch of crazy students, right? The technology 
        and patterns of thought that have come out of building human powered airplanes 
        is pretty amazing. If you are up to date on avionics and high-tech NASA 
        stuff, you are probably familiar with the Centurion and Pathfinder, both 
        light weight, manless aircraft designed to fly at ultra-high altitudes. 
        Well the company building and designing these aircrafts is AeroVironment, 
        and the founder of this company is none other than Paul MacCready- the 
        engineer behind the first successful HPA, the Gossamer Condor. So who 
        was it again questioning the validity of HPAs?</p>
      <p align="center"><span class="LargeBody">5. Q: How many man-hours have 
        been spent on this project?</span><br />
        <br />
        A: This one's easy...too many to count. We have been working for the past 
        three years on a daily basis. At least three times a week we work from 
        3-5 hours, and in the summer and on some weekends, that number quadruples. 
        There are always between half a dozen and a little more than a dozen people 
        working on the project, and we span four grades.</p>
      <p align="center"><span class="LargeBody">6. Q: How much money has been 
        spent on the project?</span><br />
        <br />
        A: In all, we have spent over $10,000 on the project. No we are not all 
        corrupt, we do actually go through this much money on tools, materials, 
        and supplies. Taxpayers don't fret, because....</p>
      <p align="center"><span class="LargeBody">7. Q: Wow! That's a lot of money, 
        where does it all come from?</span><br />
        <br />
        A: Almost none of our money comes from the district. We are primarily 
        supported by fundrasing. Numerous companies have donated supplies and/or 
        money to our program. We are forever greatful to these people! They are 
        all saints! If you are interested in helping us, please feel free to call 
        or email us!</p>
      <p align="center"><span class="LargeBody">8. Q: What's going to happen after 
        you fly the plane?</span><br />
        <br />
        A: We're all going on a trip to Tahiti to get a break from the insanity 
        of HPA! Seriously, we have no idea. Assuming the plane doesn't break between 
        the time it gets off the ground and the time it is back in our shop, we 
        are hoping some fresh blood steps up to continue the project. If we can 
        get this plane to fly, it would be nice to redesign it and make a version 
        that is actually capable of turning in at least one direction, as long 
        as it's not down.</p>
      <p align="center"><span class="LargeBody">9. Q: This is great! I want to 
        make my own HPA, how do I get started?</span><br />
        <br />
        A: First, go crazy like us because not too many sane people undertake 
        projects like this (if you don't believe us, watch the video from the 
        Birdman Rally Competition). Second, get a lot of money because these aren't 
        cheap. Third, unless you have tons of experience flying ultra-lightweight, 
        slow flying aircraft (hey, that just so happens to be your college major? 
        what a coincidence!), do lots of research. You can start by looking at 
        the Raven website or the Birdman Website, both on our links page.</p>
      <p align="center"><span class="LargeBody">10. Q: Since I'm not going to 
        be making my own human powered airplane anytime soon, how can I help you 
        with the Grasshopper?</span><br />
        <br />
        A: We can use all the help we can get. However, this doesn't mean we want 
        you coming down in your work clothes, ready to get it on, because the 
        majority of the time, we have more than enough hands. You can help us 
        by supporting us either monitarily, through supplies and donations, or 
        with insurance. Please call oremail us for more information! We would 
        LOVE to talk to you ;-)</p>
