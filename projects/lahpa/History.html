    <p align="left"><br />
      Three years ago, a group of seniors found a video from the annual Birdman 
      Competition held in Japan. In this competition, private companies and organizations 
      construct large gliders and human powered aircraft, and see who can get 
      them to travel the farthest when pushed off a cliff overlooking a harbor. 
      Seeing this video inspired the seniors to construct their own human powered 
      airplane. <br />
    </p>
    <p align="center"><span class="XLargeBody">Research</span></p>
    <p align="left"><br />
      They began by purchasing a radio-controlled airplane and using the wing 
      as a model to build their own scale wing. Unfortunately, this wing had many 
      problems, so rather then working down a dead end; they began to talk to 
      some people from the Birdman Competition. The people they contacted told 
      them about a man named Dr. Paul MacCready, the first person to ever successfully 
      fly a human powered aircraft in a &quot;Figure 8,&quot; winning him the 
      Kremer Prize from the British Crown. After purchasing copies of Dr. Paul 
      MacCready's biography of the project and a video documenting his first plane, 
      the Gossamer Condor, the seniors finally had an opportunity to meet Dr. 
      MacCready and talk to him about building an HPA. Dr. MacCready gave the 
      seniors a copy of the blueprints of the Condor, along with a lot of advice, 
      and the stern warning that HPAs aren't a good project for high school students. 
      <br />
    </p>
    <p align="center"><span class="XLargeBody">Work Begins</span></p>
    <p align="left"><br />
      <br />
      Using what knowledge they could, the seniors began work on the airplane. 
      They did a tremendous amount of fundraising and PR work, getting several 
      thousand dollars, which went towards purchasing materials. By the end of 
      the school year, the HPA team had grown to include a group of sophomores 
      in addition to the existing seniors. This team had completed the design 
      of the airplane, working from the Condor blueprints and then modifying them 
      until they had their own, unique, airplane. They worked tirelessly through 
      the summer, until early August, when they decided to make an attempt to 
      fly the still-incomplete airplane. <br />
    </p>
    <p align="center"><span class="XLargeBody">San Bernardino Airport</span></p>
    <p align="left"><br />
      In August, the hottest month of the year, we moved almost the entire Engineering 
      Tech lab out to an open hangar at the San Bernardino Airport, where we would 
      attempt to complete the plane and fly it. After working for seven days, 
      we had completed all of the wing sections and had them attached to the fuselage. 
      For the first time, the airplane started looking like just that. Unfortunately, 
      we discovered that our tail section was far too heavy and that it would 
      never fly in its present state. Rather than just pack up and leave, we decided 
      to try to pull test the airplane. This involves attaching a rope to a bicycle 
      and pulling the plane at a low speed to try and achieve lift. When we decided 
      to try the test, it was about six in the afternoon, and we were all exhausted 
      from working, but had renewed energy, thinking we would see our creation 
      get off the ground. Without discussing the flight plan, we hastily started 
      the test, pushing it at about 10 miles per hour, much faster than we should 
      have. The plane definitely got lift- too much, in fact. With so much lift, 
      the left wing went into a stall, and the strain on the wing caused one of 
      the tubes to fail and bend. Hearts broken, we tried to make a new wing section 
      the next day, but it just wasn't meant to be because that afternoon, a sand 
      storm rolled in and destroyed most of our wing sections. <br />
    </p>
    <p align="center"><span class="XLargeBody">Rebuilding</span></p>
    <p align="left"><br />
      The following year was spent reorganizing the plane and redesigning a lot 
      of the problematic components. Being that the remaining team members (the 
      rest went off to college) were all juniors, and previously the scrubs, there 
      was a lack of organization and leadership. We were able to talk to a lot 
      of people who have worked with airplanes, including Paul Illian, a Boeing 
      engineer working on a state of the art HPA that he hopes will be the first 
      to fly 100 miles nonstop. By the end of the year, we had successfully redesigned 
      and rebuilt much of the plane. Currently, the plane is nearly complete, 
      for the second time. We are planning on taking it to March Air Force Base 
      in Riverside over spring break for another attempt at flying it.</p>
