    <p><span class="LargeBody">Botball (www.botball.org) is a robotics competition 
      incorporating Lego building with computer programming to build an autonomous 
      robot. Each team of students receives a kit which includes various Lego 
      pieces for building as well as a programmable Lego brick known as the RCX 
      which includes motors, bumper sensors, and a light sensor. The kit also 
      includes another &#8220;brain&#8221; known as the Handy Board which has 
      motors as well as a variety of light and touch sensors. Both the RCX and 
      Handy Board are programmed using the C programming language. The object 
      of the game is to create a program that will score points by moving ping 
      pong balls and foam balls as well as PVC tubing into different scoring zones. 
      Each team competes in a regional competition and is eligible for the national 
      competition.</span><br />

    <p>Students gain hands on experience as they design, build, and program&nbsp; 
      their own mobile robot. These robots have no remote control and must rely 
      on their programming to maneuver around the game board. <br />
      <br />
      Sound challenging? Don't worry, the KISS Institute provides a teacher workshop, 
      tech support and all the materials you need to learn the basics of robotics. 
      The best part is, schools keep the equipment for use in the classroom after 
      the tournament is complete. Your team will receive KISS Institute's specialized 
      kit of cutting edge robotics equipment used by major universities. It includes 
      sensors, motors, customized robot computers, selected LEGO Technic pieces, 
      software, and documentation. We provide everything you need to stretch your 
      students' imaginations and build a robot that can play and win at Botball. 
      <br />
      <br />
      Botball is a high tech game that's high energy. Botball kicks off with a 
      3-day teacher tutorial where educators learn the basics of robotics. Students 
      then have about six weeks to create their robot. The project culminates 
      in a fast paced tournament where robots face off in regional competitions. 
      <br />
      <br />
      The game is played on a 4'X8' board where robots score points by placing 
      black or white balls in scoring position. Robots use no remote control and 
      are programmed by students. Botball requires a robot with brains and that's 
      where you come in. <br />
      <br />
      Botball teaches computer programming in the C language. You and your students 
      can be on the cutting edge as they program in one of the most popular computer 
      languages used in science and business. C programmers are in high demand 
      and these skills help make your students highly employable once they enter 
      "the real world."” </p>

    <p align="left">Botball is an Artificial Intelligence competition consisting 
      of: sensors, LEGOs, a programming language, and two robotic brains called 
      the “Handyboard” and the “RCX”. Team mates must come up with a strategy 
      to score as many points as possible and build a robot that will be able 
      to execute the plan with efficiency, which must be consisting of a brain, 
      sensors, and LEGOs. Using the computer language, known as “C”, programmers 
      program the robot to do what they want it to do. During the competition, 
      they may be allowed to modify the program at any given time. The competition 
      consists of three seeding rounds, which will determine who you will go up 
      against in the head to head rounds. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Los 
      Altos High School started its first Botball Competition in February 2002. 
      Los Altos started with two teams, one team consisted of freshmen and sophomores 
      (Team Red), the other was comprised of juniors and seniors (Team Blue). 
      The teams worked hard for 6 weeks, which resulted in their two LEGO robots, 
      Posbot from Team Blue, and Phatbot from Team Red. The Regional Competitions 
      in April, held at Gabrillieno High School in San Gabriel, tested the abilities 
      of the robots to perform certain tasks in a game-like environment. The results 
      were exceptional for Team Red, who finished in third and placed themselves 
      in the Nationals. But unfortunately, Team Blue did not make it. But they 
      did not go home empty handed, they ended up winning the “Judges Choice” 
      award for their robot's excelled ability to wrestle. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To prepare 
      for the National Competition in July, the Red Team started to get to work 
      on a new robot in May. They went to Nationals in Norman, Oklahoma, and after 
      three days of intense competition, Los Altos finished 7th overall.“ </p>
