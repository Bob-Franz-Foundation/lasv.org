  All schools owe $40.00 for the first team and $10.00 for each additional team 
  for construction of a practice board. Notify us of how you plan pay us so that 
  we can make those arrangements<br />
  <br />
  All kits require a PC with a USB port. Notify us if you do not have a PC with 
  a USB and for an additional fee, we will purchase the converter necessary for 
  you to run on a non USB PC.<br />
  <br />
  Those of you who have not, please notify us of how many teams you will have 
  and when you will be getting your kit's. Based on this info a schedule for the

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br />
  <font size="+1"><strong> Robots</strong></font><br />
  &middot; The robot's dimensions must not exceed 18&#8221; wide X 12&#8221; long 
  X 12&#8221; high.<br />
  &middot; Robots can be built from any or all pieces included within the Lego&reg; 
  MindStorms&reg; kit. Significant limitations include 1 RCX minicomputer and 
  2 Lego&reg; motors.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>Scoring</em></strong></font><em><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></em><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br />
  &middot; To score in a colored area or in a goal, any part of the desired object 
  must be within the vertical projection of the destination.<br />
  &middot; Toilet paper tubes must be at an angle greater than 45&deg; to count 
  as being knocked over.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="+1"><em>Seeding</em></font></strong><br />
  &middot; The Seeding Round Competitions will consist of three rounds for each 
  team.<br />
  &middot; Each team will automatically be assigned to the &#8220;black&#8221; 
  side of the board for all seeding rounds.<br />
  &middot; Each round will be exactly 60 seconds long in which one team alone 
  will take the field and attempt to score as many points as possible.<br />
  &middot; If a robot fails to terminate before the allotted time expires, a score 
  of -1 one will be awarded to that team for that round.<br />
  &middot; The average of the top two seeding round scores for each team will 
  be taken and used to determine bracketing for head-to-head.<br />
  &middot; Each team will have a few minutes between rounds to make any changes 
  necessary.<br />
  &middot; Any team not ready to begin a round will receive a score of -1 for 
  that round.<br />
  &middot; In order to receive a valid score, each team must attempt to score 
  points, no sitting around and winning because the other teams have negative 
  points (were such situation to arise that team would also receive a score of 
  -1).<br />
  &middot; Each team will receive -1 point for each &#8220;white&#8221; object 
  in scoring position.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="+1"><em>Head-to-Head</em></font></strong><br />
  &middot; The Head-to-Head rounds of the competition will occur after the Seeding 
  round competition is completed. Placements depend on the performance of the 
  seeding rounds.<br />
  &middot; The same rules will apply to the Head-to-Head round that had applied 
  to the Seeding Rounds, such as scoring and time limits.<br />
  &middot; The Head-to-Head competitions will be an elimination setup in which 
  those that prevail will be able to move onto the next round inn the winner brs 
  bracket and all losers must move to the losers brackets.<br />
  &middot; Once a team, has lost in the losers bracket, that team is eliminated 
  from competition. <br />
