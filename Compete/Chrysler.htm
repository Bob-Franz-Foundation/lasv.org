The "Build Your Dream Vehicle" Program was developed by Chrysler 

Corporation for high school students in grades 9-12.

<P>

Its purpose was to provide students with an oppertunity to:

<UL>

<LI>Work as part of a team</LI>

<LI>Explore an interesting part of the world of work</LI>

<LI>Combine the academic knowledge and vocational skills of the students</LI>

<LI>Design an environmentally friendly, or alternative energy, futuristic vehicle</LI>

</UL>

<P>

The first round of competition was the judging of written reports of

the marketing plan, ergonimics, safety features, environmental friendlyness,

and drawings of the car.  Most groups also send in a 3-D model

of their car.  In the second round of competition, the finalists from the first round make presentations in front of judges.

Every year students from Los Altos compete in the compitition.  Since Los Altos started participating in the compititionin in 1996, we have placed exceptionaly every year.  In 1996 we placed 1st also placing both 1st and 2nd place in 1997 and 1998.  In 1999 we placed 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place.  Which makes the total cash prize of $6000.
