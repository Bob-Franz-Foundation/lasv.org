This project began duringFeburary of 1997 and our class was divided into two groups, LASV (Los AltosSolar Vehicle) and LAHPA. </P><H3>OBJECTIVES</H3><P>Currently 15 students in LAHPA project. Our current goal is to havethe specs for the HPA ready by May 1997, and our ultimate intent is tofly the HPA for 100 meters. We have some materials for HPA, but we stillneed many more assistance as for design and financial sponsors and supporters.If you are interested or have any suggestions, please contact us at <A HREF="http://mailto:LAHPA@hotmail.com">LAHPA@hotmail.com</A>.Thank you. </P><H3>Here are some links to other HPA projects.</H3><P><A HREF="http://www.ihpva.org/Raven">The RAVEN Project - Home Page<BR></A><A HREF="http://www.bekkoame.or.jp/~kidachi/HPA-e.html">Do you knowHuman-Powered Airplane?<BR></A><A HREF="http://www.aero.cst.nihon-u.ac.jp/hpv/hpa/picindex">HPA Pictures</A><BR><HR></P><H5 ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="http://www.lasv.org">BACK TO HOME</A></H5></BODY></HTML>
